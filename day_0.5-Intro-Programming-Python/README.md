# Notes

---

**The creator of python**

I noticed due to long time of complex thinking I noticed that the creator of python has lost control over his forehead muscles.

**video 01**

Dr. Chulk explained why it is important to learn programming that I found very helpful. He also gave some good examples. 

**video 02**

Dr. Chulk explained hardwarte components with practical examples which made it very easy to understand.

**video 03**

Very good visual of what happens if you remove the CPU cooler .

**video 04**

Great to see copy-paste, delete operations taking place inside of a hard drive.

**video 05**

Loved the way how Chulk started teaching the python language. Yes I am in Slytherine too, time to talk with snakes in python.

**video 06**

Liked the way he started chapter one (basics)!
