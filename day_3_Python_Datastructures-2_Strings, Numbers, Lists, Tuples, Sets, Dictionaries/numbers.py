num = 3
print (type(num))

# arithmetic operations

# addition : 3+2
print(312+265)
# subtraction: 3-2
print(312-265)
# multiplication: 3*2
print(312*265)
# division: 3/2 ,it will take the decimal
print(3/2)
# floor division: 3//2,it will ignore the decimal
print(3//2)
# exponent: 3**3, it works like power 3**3=3*3*3
print(3**3)
# modulus: 3 % 2, it prints remainder of the division , it usually helps to define either a number is even or odd
print(3%2)

# abs and round

print(type(-3))

print(round(3.75,1))

# it will print 3.8 as 1 means will keep rounding version to one place


# comparisons : 
# Equal: 3 == 2
#not equal: 3!=2
# greater than : 3 > 2
# less than : 3 < 2
# greater or equal: 3 >= 2
