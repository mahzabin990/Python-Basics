1. **What is meant by Boolean Datatype?**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer: Boolean datatypes are expressions expressing true or false. They belong to a class bool.
    
    </aside>
    
2. **What are boolean operators?**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer: Boolean operators take boolean inputs and return boolean results.
    
    </aside>
    
3. **List out all possible boolean operators available in python.**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer: and,or,not
    
    </aside>
    
4. **Demonstrate a sample execution of each of the boolean operators in python. You must use comments to properly explain each line.** 
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer:
    
    ```python
    # and opeerator
    x=5
    y=True
    
    if x>2 and y: #both of theb statements are true .
      print (True)
    else:
      print('not satisfied your condition')
    #or operator
    x=5
    y=False
    
    if x>2 or y: #only one statement is true and other is wrong
      print (True)
    else:
      print('not satisfied your condition')
    #not operator
    x=5
    y=False
    
    if x>2 and not y:# y is false, in this statement not true makes it false
      print (True)
    else:
      print('not satisfied your condition')
    
    ```
    
    </aside>
    
5. **What does the term *Exception* mean in python?**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer: errors that occur after processing the test.
    
    </aside>
    
6. **What is a *Traceback Error*? Mention two possible ways to handle errors in python?**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer: A traceback error can occur when there is a exception in the code. I can handle this error using try/except method.
    
    </aside>
    
7. **Demonstrate an example of *Exception* in python.**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer:
    
    ```python
    
    Name='Lira'
    try:
        N=int(Name)
    except:
        N=-1
    print('My',N)
    ```
    
    </aside>
    
8. **Complete the 1st exercise in the book.**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer:
    
    ```python
    rate = 10
    new_rate = 1.5*10
    hours = int(input('Enter hours:'))
    
    if int(hours) > 40:
        P = hours*new_rate
        print('Pay:',P)
    elif int(hours)==40 or int(hours) < 40:
        P = hours*rate
        print('Pay:',P)
    ```
    
    </aside>
    
9. **Complete the 2nd exercise in the book.**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer:
    
    ```python
    rate=10
    new_rate=1.5*10
    try:
        hours = int(input('Enter hours:')) 
        if int(hours) > 40:
          P = hours*new_rate
          print('Pay:',P)
        elif int(hours) == 40 or int(hours) < 40:
          P = hours*rate
          print('Pay:',P)
    except:
        print('Error, please enter numeric input')
    
    ```
    
    </aside>
    
10. **Suppose you work at sales in a coffee shop, meaning you take orders from customers. Your coffee shop only sales coffee and chocolate drinks. To order a coffee the customer needs to be 18 or above. Otherwise he/she is allowed to have a chocolate drink.** 
    
    **Convert this scenario into python code. Also make sure that this code can also handle errors. So if any error occurs, it should print a custom message that you wrote. For example, if anyone enters a name instead of a number, your program should print something like: ‚ÄúPlease enter the number correctly‚Äù.**
    
    <aside>
    üìù Answer:
    
    ```python
    # Paste your code here.
    
    try:
        customer_age=int(input('Please enter the customer age:'))
        
        if  int(customer_age) >= 18:
          print('We are serving both coffee and chocolate milk.')
        elif  int(customer_age) < 18:
          print('We are serving only chocolate milk.')
    except:
        print('Please enter the number correctly')
    ```
